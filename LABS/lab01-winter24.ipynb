(Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) Please don't just share answers, though.\n",

    "### Getting Help\n",
    "1. We encourage you to complete your lab with a group of peers during one of the weekly TA office hours, feel free to ask the TAs any questions.\n",
